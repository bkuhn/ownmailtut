# Package Installation

This configuration was done for Debian GNU/Linux 8 (aka jessie).
Instructions for most Debian, Debian-based and Debian-derived systems should
work roughly similarly, but these instructions were only tested on jessie.

Install the basic operating system to start, of course, and the you want the
following packages:

     # aptitude install postfix postgrey dovecot postfix-policyd-spf-python
