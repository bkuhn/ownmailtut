# TODO Items for this tutorial

* Write [prep work SSL section](PrepWork.md#ssl-certificate).

* [Explain policy-spf configuration](Postfix.md#configuring-spf-policy-daemon).

* go through [mail in a box](https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox), and see what they do and what configuration it yields, and either add that to this tutorial too, or explain why my tutorial recommends something different than mailinabox.
